1. Project Title 
Digital Based Shape Generator using Python 
2. Problem Statement 
To design and implement a Python program that allows users to generate different 
geometric shapes such as square, rectangle, triangle, pyramid, and diamond using * 
characters. The program should be interactive and menu-driven, allowing the user to 
select the shape and size. 
3. Objective 
• To simulate basic geometric shapes using programming logic. 
• To practice menu-driven programming. 
• To understand loops and conditional statements in Python. 
• To provide a visual and interactive representation of shapes. 
4. Tools Used 
• Python 3 
• VS Code / IDLE (for coding and execution) 
5. Description 
This project allows the user to generate multiple geometric shapes using a simple menu. 
The shapes include square, rectangle, triangle, pyramid, and diamond. The program 
takes input for size or dimensions and prints the shapes on the console using * symbols. 
It is designed to be user-friendly and modular. 
6. Algorithm 
1. Display a menu for the user to select the desired shape. 
2. Read the user’s choice. 
3. Based on the choice: 
o Square: Take size and print a square of *. 
o Rectangle: Take rows and columns, then print a rectangle of *. 
o Triangle: Take size and print a right-angled triangle of *. 
o Pyramid: Take size and print a centered pyramid of *. 
o Diamond: Take size and print a symmetric diamond of *. 
4. Repeat until the user chooses to exit. 
 
9. Result 
The Digital Shape Generator successfully prints all shapes (square, rectangle, triangle, 
pyramid, diamond) according to the user input. The program is interactive, menu-driven, and 
demonstrates the use of loops and conditional statements in Python. 
10. Conclusion 
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build an interactive, menu-driven 
program that generates geometric shapes. It helps in understanding loops, conditionals, and 
modular programming, while providing a visual representation of basic shapes.
